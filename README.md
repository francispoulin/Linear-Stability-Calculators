# Linear-Stability-Calculators

This repo will provide code to solve the linear stability problem for various fluid dynamical systems.  This will include geophysical, astrophyiscial and biological models.  The idea is to learn as much as possible from the linear theory before moving to nonlinear simulations.  There will be options to do this using spectral or finite difference methods.
